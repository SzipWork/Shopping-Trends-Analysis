# Identifying Shopping Trends using Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes shopping behavior using data analysis techniques to identify key consumer trends. By leveraging statistical analysis and machine learning, it extracts insights from purchase patterns, customer demographics, and seasonal trends.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Collected customer purchase data.
- **Features:** Customer ID, purchase amount, product category, timestamp, demographics, etc.
- **Objective:** Identify trends, customer preferences, and market insights.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/shopping-trends-analysis.git
   cd shopping-trends-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash

   ```

## Data Analysis Techniques
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing shopping trends, seasonality, and customer segmentation.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Correlation, distribution analysis, and hypothesis testing.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Clustering (K-Means), regression models, and classification models to predict shopping behavior.
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI for insightful reports.

## Key Insights & Findings
- Identified peak shopping seasons and most popular product categories.
- Analyzed customer spending behavior and loyalty patterns.
- Provided data-driven recommendations for marketing strategies and inventory management.

## Usage
